# Steven Diep Portfolio Project

## Description

This project is a portfolio website detailing who I am, my education, experience, and projects. The portfolio website was created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The Bootstrap framework was also used for styling and to add functionality to the navbar.

The contact form is not implemented so no messages will actually be sent. However, the contact form does validate any input using JavaScript and will tell the user if the input is valid or not.

To run this project, you can download the files and run the index.html file or visit the website itself. My portfolio website is currently deployed at: https://stevdiep-pdx.github.io/webdev-portfolio/.

## Frameworks

Bootstrap was used in this project to implement the navbar's collapsing function, the project cards, the spacing of some elements, and general styling for the contact form.
